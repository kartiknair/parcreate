# Parcreate

Parcreate is a dead simple react boilerplate that uses paarcel for bundling. I speak more about how you can set up parcel with react in [this blog post](https://blog.kartikn.me/parcel-react).

## Getting started

There's two ways to use parcreate the new & recommended way (because you will alwaays be up to date) is with `npx`, assuming you have node.js & npm>5.2.0 installed you can run the following command:

```bash
npx parcreate my-apps-name
```

If you would like to do it the old fashioned way then you can run the following commands:

```bash
npm i -g parcreate
parcreate my-apps-name
```
